## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This is my first self made React project. I learnt a lot of things while buildings this project. I learned about react components and states with `useState` hooks. React doesn't allow to interect wiht DOM directly, it creates a virtual DOM and manage it through states. I also learned conditional rendering of components on user interaction.

### Useful resources

- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - This helped me to understand and write down markdown.

- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Free Resources for most of the programming languages with detailed examples.

- [react.dev](https://react.dev/) - official react documention to learn react.
